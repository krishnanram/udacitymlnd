'''
For this project, you will be given five technical interviewing
 questions on a variety of topics discussed in the technical
 interviewing course.

 You should write up a clean and efficient
 answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency
 of your code and your design choices.

 A qualified reviewer will
 look over your answer and give you feedback on anything that might
 be awesome or lacking—is your solution the most efficient one
 possible? Are you doing a good job of explaining your thoughts? Is
 your code elegant and easy to read?

Submission Instructions

For each question, create a solution in Python (version 2). All
solutions should be functions named as “question1”, “question2”, et
cetera. Feel free to make additional helper functions or classes as
needed. Code solutions must be in a file called "solutions.py".

In the same .py file, include at least 3 test cases for each
solution.

For each test case, write the function call with the input
you want to test and print it to the console, like "print
question1()".
On the next line, comment out the output you expect to
see from that function call. At least 2 of these must be edge cases,
testing inputs such as null values, empty inputs, unusually large
values, et cetera.

Write up an explanation for each question in a single separate text
file (called "explanations.txt").

Your paragraph should not be a
detailed walkthrough of the code you provided, but provide your
reasoning behind decisions made in the code.

 For example, why did
you use that data structure?

You also need to explain the efficiency
(time and space) of your solution.
Compress your one Python and one text file into a .zip, and submit.
